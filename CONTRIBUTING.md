snowpatch contribution guidelines
=================================

Contributions should be sent as patches to the mailing list
([snowpatch@lists.ozlabs.org](mailto:snowpatch@lists.ozlabs.org)),
preferably using `git send-email`. We strongly prefer emailed patches
over GitHub pull requests - after all, emailed patches are exactly why
snowpatch exists!

Patch status is tracked on [patchwork.ozlabs.org](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/snowpatch/).

All commit messages must include a `Signed-off-by:` line including
your real name, indicating that you have read and agree to the
[Developer Certificate of Origin
v1.1](http://developercertificate.org).

Please read the Linux kernel
[SubmittingPatches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
guidance before contributing. While many of the rules in there
obviously aren't relevant to snowpatch, a lot of the guidance is
relevant. Specifically, pay attention to:

 * Descriptive commit messages
 * Separating logical changes into separate patches
 * Plain-text patches, as generated by `git send-email`

We like to follow the [Rust Guidelines](https://aturon.github.io/)
where possible - patches to fix existing non-compliant code are
welcome!

If you're using a nightly Rust toolchain, run `cargo build --features clippy`
to use the [clippy](https://github.com/Manishearth/rust-clippy) linter.

When your patch involves creating a new file, where possible please
use a header along the lines of:

```
