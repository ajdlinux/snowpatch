snowpatch contribution guidelines
=================================

Contributions should be sent as patches to the mailing list
([snowpatch@lists.ozlabs.org](mailto:snowpatch@lists.ozlabs.org)),
preferably using `git send-email`. We strongly prefer emailed patches
over GitHub pull requests - after all, emailed patches are exactly why
snowpatch exists!

Patch status is tracked on [patchwork.ozlabs.org](https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/snowpatch/).

All commit messages must include a `Signed-off-by:` line including
your real name, indicating that you have read and agree to the
[Developer Certificate of Origin
v1.1](http://developercertificate.org).

Please read the Linux kernel
[SubmittingPatches](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
guidance before contributing. While many of the rules in there
obviously aren't relevant to snowpatch, a lot of the guidance is
relevant. Specifically, pay attention to:

 * Descriptive commit messages
 * Separating logical changes into separate patches
 * Plain-text patches, as generated by `git send-email`

We like to follow the [Rust Style
Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md)
wherever possible - patches to fix any non-compliant code are welcome!
The `setup_rustfmt_hook.sh` script in the root of the repository will
set up a local pre-commit hook that runs `rustfmt` over your changes -
we strongly recommend using this.

We also recommend using the
[clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) linter.

When your patch involves creating a new file, where possible please
use a header along the lines of:

```
